# ChainVault: Own Your Data. Forever.

ChainVault is a blockchain-powered storage system built on the Internet Computer — offering secure, decentralized file storage.

## 🚀 About The Project

### The Problem

Our digital data lives on fragile ground. Files are locked in centralized servers, vulnerable to hacks, takedowns, and silent deletions. There's no guarantee of privacy, persistence, or true ownership.

For students, creators, developers, and businesses alike, this leads to limited trust and broken workflows — especially when relying on centralized notes, documents, and file-sharing systems.

### Our Solution

ChainVault provides a trustless, on-chain file storage system with optional AI capabilities. Built on the Internet Computer, it delivers high-speed decentralized storage while offering intelligent content understanding.

#### Key Features:

- **On-Chain File Storage**: Data is stored and served directly from smart contracts — no gateways, no central servers.
- **Immutable & Verifiable**: All files are cryptographically anchored and auditable for tamper resistance.
- **Seamless Access**: Log in via wallet. Upload and access your content with a simple interface.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

### Install the required packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Tixia's Design System

```bash
npm run install:tixia
```

### Starts the replica, running in the background

```bash
npm run dfx:start
```

### Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface

```bash
npm run dfx:deploy
```

## 🔍 How It Works

ChainVault simplifies decentralized storage with just a few intuitive steps. No blockchain experience required. Built for both technical and non-technical users.

1. Connect your crypto wallet using Internet Identity.
2. Upload any file, note, or document through our secure Web3 interface.
